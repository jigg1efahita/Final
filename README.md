# Basic Audio Program Cheatsheat
## By Ryan Brixey

This Cheatsheat will go over some of the basics you would need to know when using an audio program. This is for anyone who is interested in using a mixing program, but doesn't know where to start.
We will primarily be focusing on the Audacity and Audition programs, as they are some of the most common.

First we need to download a program. If you want to download Audacity for free you can [here](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/ "Audacity Website"), or are willing to pay for Audition, you can get it [here](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/plans.html?single_app=audition&promoid=KTKBC&mv=other "Adobe Store Page"). Some might already have  CreativeCloud, so you should be able to easily get it through that.

### Opening a New Project

When starting up with Audacity, it automatically sets the project sample rate to 44100 Hz, the industry standard for CD production.

Audacity:

This will be in the bottom left corner of the screen

Right when you open Audacity you can get started with the project.

Audition has a couple more steps to get started. I will start up and you will have to create a new multitrack session, either by clicking File/New/Multitrack Session, or by clicking Ctrl + N. This box will pop up.

 You can then add a name to the project, choose its location, and other options. It starts with 48000 Hz sample rate, and for beginners this or 44100 Hz is fine. The bit depth is also not as important for beginners, but make sure the master is in stereo. Most projects will be in stereo, a mono master is not very common. Now you are ready to start.

 ### Recording

 If you need to start a recording, first things first is to make sure you have a working input. Whether it be a microphone or a mixer input. Most won't have a mixing board to set up, so we will go over Mic setup.

 Make sure the Microphone is plugged in and detected by the computer and the program. You can check with windows by going to the Sound control panel, you can easily find it by searching for it, or right clicking the volume control in the bottom right.

 In Mac, you can go to System Preferences, go to Sound, and click the inputs tab.

 After that, the audio program you are using should auto detect what microphone you want.

 Audacity shows the inputs and outputs at the top of the window, next to the playback controls.

 And now you can just press record, or the R key, to start a recording.

 Audition is a bit different, and has a few steps.

 This box is near the center and is at the beginning of each track. To choose your microphone, you click input then choose Mono or stereo, stereo would be the go to choice, then choose your microphone. If there are no options, then check the Audio Hardware found in that input tab. It will look like this.

 Change the default input to your microphone then you should be ready for the next step. On the track box, click the R button to prime the mic for recording. If it's working it will show green bars, or levels, on the right side of the box.

 Now you are ready to record, you can press the record button, or the R key, just like in Audacity.
